# ðŸš— **Car Rental System**

## Overview
The **Car Rental System** is a simple console application built to demonstrate key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The program allows users to **rent different types of cars**, with dynamic rental pricing based on the car type and rental duration. 

This project is a **work in progress** as I continue to enhance and improve the system with more features and better functionality.

### **OOP Concepts Used:**
- **Classes & Objects**: Core classes representing different car types (e.g., `Car`, `ElectricCar`, `Sedan`).
- **Inheritance**: Derived car classes extend the base `Car` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Different car types override rental methods to adjust pricing and logic.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes define common methods for all car types, hiding implementation details.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **C#**: The primary programming language.
- **.NET Core**: Framework for building and running the console application.

## Work in Progress:

- [ ] **Create Car Selection Interface**: Implement a user interface for selecting cars.
- [ ] **Car Availability System**: Track car availability to prevent double bookings and ensure users can only rent available cars.
- [ ] **Add Database Integration**: Store car details, rental transactions, and customer information in a database (using **SQLite** or **MySQL**).
- [ ] **Implement User Accounts**: Allow customers to create accounts, save rental history, and manage bookings.
- [ ] **Payment System**: Integrate a payment gateway for processing payments (such as **Stripe** or **PayPal**).
- [ ] **Rental History**: Add functionality to track and display rental history for users.
- [ ] **Implement Error Handling**: Enhance the program with better error handling, validations, and user input feedback.
