1. Keep Documentation Versioned
•	Store all documentation files (e.g., README.md, design decisions, API docs) in your version control system (Git).
•	Update documentation in the same pull request or commit as code changes that affect it.
2. Update Documentation with Every Significant Change
•	Whenever you add, modify, or remove features, update the relevant documentation immediately.
•	For design or architectural changes, add or update a Design Decision Record (ADR).
3. Use Clear Structure and Organization
•	Organize docs in logical folders (e.g., /docs, /docs/decisions).
•	Use consistent naming conventions for files and folders.
4. Link Related Documents
•	Reference related documentation (e.g., link from README.md to design decisions or project plan).
•	Cross-link between ADRs if decisions are related.
5. Write for Your Audience
•	Use clear, concise language.
•	Include code examples, diagrams, or usage instructions where helpful.
6. Review and Prune Regularly
•	Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., at the end of each sprint or major release) to ensure documentation is current.
•	Remove or update outdated information.
7. Encourage Contributions
•	If working with others, provide guidelines for contributing to documentation (e.g., in a CONTRIBUTING.md file).
•	Review documentation changes as part of code reviews.
8. Automate Where Possible
•	Use tools to generate or validate documentation (e.g., docstring extractors, markdown linters).
•	Consider badges or status indicators for documentation coverage or freshness.
