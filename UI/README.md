The UI folder contains the Console View and Menu Logic of the application. It is responsible for presenting information to the user and handling user input. This separation allows for a clean architecture where the user interface is decoupled from the business logic and data access layers, promoting maintainability and testability. The UI layer interacts with the Services layer to retrieve and display data as needed.
